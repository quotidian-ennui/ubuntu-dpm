Some things have additional paramters as listed here
'aws'
  install             : Install the AWS CLI
  update|upgrade      : Update the AWS CLI
  uninstall|rm         : Remove the AWS CLI (but not ~/.aws)
'goenv'
  install|latest      : Install goenv itself and golang
  update              : Update the git repo that provides it
'pyenv'
  install|latest      : Install pyenv itself and a python
  prepare             : Install the sane dev environment as recommended by pyenv
  update              : Update the git repo that provides it
'java'
  install             : install baseline java tools (java/gradle/maven/jbang)
                        For backwards compatibility, this is the default behaviour.
  reset [candidate]   : reset the version of the candidate to what is configured in the
                        SDK_CONFIG file.
  upgrade [candidate] : upgrade an sdkman candidate (e.g. gradle) to its latest version
                        and delete the current version.

                        This behaviour is largely because sdkman leaves previous versions
                        dangling, and for some tools you never want to use a previous
                        version.
